## Abstract
This repository contains the datasets for our research on the use of GPT-4 for generating multiple choice questions (MCQs) to assess subject matter expertise (SME) in medical translation. Our study aims to model the skills of potential subject matter experts in a human-in-the-loop machine translation (MT) flow, ensuring task alignment with individuals' skill profiles. We evaluated GPT-4-generated questions and answers focusing on English–European Portuguese and English–German language pairs, proposing a methodology for prompt creation and output evaluation.

## Repository Contents
-  `/question_banks`: Contains the question banks generated by GPT-4, categorized by topic, language, and question type. Includes evaluation by medical translation experts.
-  `/prompts`: Contains the prompts used to generate the question banks
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, dataset descriptions, and usage guidelines.


## How to Use This Repository
Researchers and practitioners can use the provided question banks and prompts to replicate our study or apply our methodology to other fields of SME assessment.
