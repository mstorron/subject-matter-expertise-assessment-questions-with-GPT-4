QB1,"I want to test the subject matter expertise of medical translators within the topic of clinical trials and clinical trial protocols. Create a questionnaire, fully in English, containing 50 multiple choice questions. Each question must have a stem and 4 answer choices in the format A), B), C) and D). Ask about terminology taken from real life clinical trials and clinical trials protocols. Include plausible distractors in the answer choices, which means the answer choices should be similar to each other and the question in category, morphology or syntax. All the answer choices must have similar length. Do not include correct answers that share the same root as words in the stem. Make sure every question includes specialized terminology found in real life clinical trials or clinical trial protocols, so that the questionnaire would be impossible for someone with no expertise in medicine to answer correctly. Identify the correct answer at the end of each question."
